  I'm a Machine Learning (ML) and Software Engineer with roots in particle physics, currently based in Switzerland. 
  Presently, I work as a ML Engineer in the Swiss AI startup Acodis, which is dedicated to transforming physical documents into structured and machine-readable data to enable the digital transformation of businesses.  
  In 2021, Acodis was named as one of the [Forbes 30 most innovative AI startups in the DACH region](https://www.forbes.at/artikel/forbes-ki-30-dach-2021-die-liste.html).
  Before I started working in industry, I had the wonderful opportunity to do research in elementary particle physics and cosmology and later in applied ML for medical imaging. 

  I have always been attracted by the power of statistical methods, be it the application to phase transitions in physics, or applying complex ML models to vast amounts of data.
  I am fascinated by both by the mathematical models of reality used in physics due to their interpretability, and the data-centric approach of ML leveraging vast amounts of real-world data.
  Some of the topics I've worked on include (check out [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aG6ipTcAAAAJ&hl=en) for a complete list):
    - Computer vision & generative ML for medical imaging
    - Natural Language Processing for Document AI
    - Modified gravity cosmology
    - Gravitational wave physics
    - Neutrino physics
    - Automaton-based simulations for biophysics

          In a team of two, we built a web-based tool, providing an overview of housing prices and rents in Switzerland. 
          Moreover, we used ML to predict prices and rents in areas with no or little data to provide high-resolution estimates for the Swiss housing market.
          We collected and curated current and historical data by means of automatic <mark>web scraping</mark>.

          Acodis is a Swiss software company that provides a SaaS platform to help companies extract structured data from documents to enable automation and digitalization of business processes.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I am part of the ML team at Acodis, responsible for research and development of new ML models that enhance existing, or enable new features of our products. 
          In this role I handle the entire ML lifecycle, implementing PoCs, handling data pre-/post-processing, as well as pre-training and fine-tuning models and the deployment of models into production. 
          Some functionalities I have enabled include detection and segmentation of tables, segmentation of document layout, key-value pair extraction, and generally enhanced document understanding by leveraging 
          data augmentation and optimization techniques, such as model quantization and parameter efficient fine-tuning of transformers <mark>PEFT</mark>.
          I have built and maintained a model server API, which serves as an interface between our document platform and GPU-backed servers, since we deploy models fully trainable by the user.
          Moreover, I am curating internal datasets for benchmarking and pre-training models on real-world data.

          As in my previous roles, I have the pleasure to supervise Master students, who write their thesis in our team and in collaboration with a Swiss University. So far, I have supervised four theses:
          - Document Clustering via multi-modal deep learning (2022/23, collaboration with EPFL, Lausanne)
          - A Visual-Interactive Tool for Information Extraction from Documents through Clustering and Data Labeling (2022, collaboration with the University of Zurich)
          - Table Detection and Structure Recognition (2021/22, collaboration with the University of Zurich)

          In my daily work I am mostly using the following tech stack: <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Pytorch</mark> <mark>FastAPI</mark> <mark>celery</mark> <mark>ClearML</mark> <mark>docker</mark> <mark>git</mark> <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> <mark>Apache Arrow</mark> <mark>Azure DevOps</mark> <mark>Google Cloud Platform</mark>

          As a researcher at the IBT, I was responsible for researching novel algorithmic approaches to brain lesion diagnostics.
          My focus was on generative ML in order to leverage the scarcely available (labeled) training data for lesion segmentation. 
          In [this published work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421008806) we show that by using image-to-image translation, one can achieve SOTA results in lesion segmentation with a fraction of the training data. 

          Apart from generative ML, I worked with various computer vision techniques and implemented various models operating on 3D imaging data, such as a 3D UNet. I also supervised a number of bachelor and master students in my time at IBT.

          In this role, I mostly used: <mark>Python</mark> <mark>C++</mark> <mark>tensorflow</mark> <mark>docker</mark> <mark>git</mark> <mark>LaTeX</mark>

          During my postdoctoral stay at MPIK, I lead and coordinated a project investigating the cosmological implications of modified gravity theories. 
          In this project, we used <mark>Python</mark> implementations of <mark> Monte Carlo</mark> methods to study the effects of modified gravity models on cosmological observables using a novel combination of astrophysical datasets.
          Thereby, we were able to derive [new constraints on such scenarios.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2020/10/040)

          During my PhD I worked on projects ranging from particle physics to cosmology trying to shed light on the identity and origin of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. 
          I worked on radiative neutrino mass models, where cosmology and astrophysical data prove to be a excellent way to test these models.
          Moreover, the [first detection of gravitational waves in 2015](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102) by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration opened an entirely new data modality for testing models by means of gravitational wave astronomy. 
          As a first application, I began to investigate the use of gravitational wave signals to constrain particle physics models via signatures in phase transitions in the early Universe. 
          In the [following publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2020)004) we investigated the signal strength of first order phase transitions in the early universe, which involves a computationally expensive fluid dynamics simulation. 
          In order to minimize the computational cost, I trained a <mark>recommender system</mark> to suggest regions of high signal strength which we would then simulate and re-use to refine the recommender. 
          Thereby, we were able to provide a systematic analysis of the parameter space, which would have been infeasible otherwise.

          Finally, I investigated the possibility of gravitational waves behaving similar to neutrinos, in the (hypothetical) setting where gravitons have a mass (or gravitational waves don't travel at the speed of light). 
          Together with my collaborators, I showed that this would lead to (unique signatures in the gravitational wave signal)(https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.111101), a result which was published in <i>Physical Review Letters</i> and presents the first thorough discussion of this phenomenon.

          As it is customary in high-energy physics, I worked with <mark>Wolfram Mathematica</mark> for all symbolic calculations, and <mark>Python</mark> for all numerical analyses. For numerical simulations, I had access to a <mark>SLURM cluster</mark>.

          In my Master classes I focussed on particle physics and cosmology as applications of statistical physics.
          In my thesis I studied radiative neutrino mass models, where the neutrino mass is generated by quantum mechanical effects, 
          and showed that some of these models have a built-in [hierarchy problem](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.095002), which severely limits their viable parameter space.

          Some of courses I took include:
          - General Relativity
          - Quantum Field Theory I+II (QED and QCD)
          - Cosmology
          - Statistical Physics II

          During my Bachelor studies I developed my interested in statistical physics, and in particular in phase transitions and renormalization group methods.
          I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on agent-based models of soft biological tissue, investigating if network formation of individual agents can be simulated by simple automaton rules, which I implemented in <mark>C++</mark>.

          Some courses I took are:
          - Programming in <mark>Java</mark>
          - Numerical methods in <mark>C++</mark>
          - Statistical physics
          - Non-linear dynamics

          Currently, you will find me rowing on Lake Zurich 2-3 times a week early in the morning (see picture below for some inspiration). 
          I am an active member of [Ruderclub Zürich](https://www.rcz.ch) and the [Zurich Penguins](https://www.zurichpenguins.ch).

          - <mark>Portuguese</mark> (which interested me due to its heavy influence on Argentinian Spanish)
          - <mark>Japanese</mark> (currently working on Kanji <mark>JLPT N3</mark>)

          Obviously, I enjoy putting these language skills to practice while traveling. 
          I have found that by interacting and conversing with people, the travel experience is lifted to a very different level.
          I also enjoy creating and consuming dishes from all around the world.
